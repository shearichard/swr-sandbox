# SWR Sandbox

This project is a place to experiment with [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/), the React state management library.

It's expected that this project will be used in conjunction with [drf-for-redux-testing](https://github.com/shearichard/drf-for-redux-testing) to provide a backend to this frontend.
